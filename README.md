\The [2020 Corona Virus Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) is sweeping over the planet. While the overall fatality rate isn’t super high and many people could have no/few symptoms, it is [more contagiuous than the flu](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-flu.html), [might survive up to 9 days outside the body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32035997), and people with preexisting conditions and [older age groups are particularly at risk](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-compared-to-flu-mortality-rates-2020-3?op=1).

It is important to slow down the spread of the virus [to make it manageable](https://mobile.twitter.com/alxrdk/status/1237021885239635969). Avoid being the transmitter by limiting exposure to other people, esp. large, dense crowds. Wash your hands [thoroughly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E).

Many epidemics are related to consumption of meat and animal agriculture. This is the source for viruses like Ebola, HIV, Bird flu, Swine flu, and likely also COVID-19, and also is creating [antibiotic resistances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnQL-brI-9I).

John Hopkins University has a neat [Dashboard showing current infections](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), but I haven’t seen charts showing how the virus spreads in different countries and states, compared to the population. So I used [their data set](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) to draw my own.
